Simplexity
==========

Simplexity is a 'simple', yet 'stylish' loading screen.
This loading screen has the capability of allowing others to create 'designs' for it.
The 'designs' are 'layouts' of the information.

Current build is __sorta__ stable.

We have a [Trello](https://trello.com/b/pXQcpmIa/simplexity)

# Designs

Designs are a nice way to customize your loading screen.
We have tried our best to make it as user-friendly to CSS/HTML developers as possible.
All options are available from the main configuration and we make it easy for developers to get the code.

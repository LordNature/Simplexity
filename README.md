Simplexity
==========

Simplexity is a __simple__, yet __stylish__ loading screen.
This loading screen has the capability of allowing others to create designs for it.
The 'designs' are layouts of the information.

Current build is __[v3.3.1](https://github.com/LordNature/Simplexity/releases/tag/v3.3.1-alpha)__(stable).

We have a [Trello](https://trello.com/b/pXQcpmIa/simplexity)
